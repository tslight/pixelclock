#+TITLE: Pixelclock

/"A different way of looking at time."/

A fork of a really neat & simple clock widget for Xorg with an added popup
dialog box, that works the same as xbattbar as I often forget what day, month
and year it is... :-/ !

#+begin_src text
  usage: pixelclock [-help] [-unraise] [-display host:dpy] [-left|-right|-top|-bottom] [-size <pixels>] [time1 time2 ... <HH:MM>]
#+end_src

** Changes in this fork

  - Add =xbattbar= inspired popup, but with modern Xft font support.
  - Default to keeping =pixelclock= on top of other windows.
  - Provide =-unraise= flag to override this behavior.
  - Change default times and colors to my personal preferences.
  - Fix some complilation errors and warnings.
  - Update to a *FreeBSD* specific Makefile.
