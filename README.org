* PIXELCLOCK

A different way of looking at time.

A fork of a really neat & simple clock widget for Xorg with an added dialog box
that works the same as xbattbar as I often forget what day, month and year it
is... :-/ !

#+begin_src text
usage: pixelclock [-display host:dpy] [-left|-right|-top|-bottom] [-size <pixels>] [time time2 ...]
#+end_src

** Changes in this fork

  - Add xbattbar inspired popup dialog box on hover that displays exact time &
    date, but with modern xft font support.
  - Always on top by default
  - Change default times and colors to my personal preferences
  - Fix some complilation errors and warnings
  - Update Makefile to work on FreeBSD
